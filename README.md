## Project 2
### [Pagination & Content Filter](https://tjaysteno.github.io/P02-pagination/ "See it now")

In this second project, I created a program that accepts a list of students of any length. It divides that list into pages of 10 students each, creates pagination links, and updates the HTML dynamically as the user navigates through those pages. Additionally, I have added a search feature that allows a user to search for students by name or email.

*__Skills:__ jQuery, DOM traversal & manipulation, unobtrusive JavaScript*

*__Personal Development Emphasis:__ modular code, concise comments, helpful names for variables & functions*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "You did it! Everything is working as you would expect it to. Your code is so short that I'm truly impressed. I like that you make all functions ready to to be executed once the window is up, hence your window.ready() on the first line. It seems you are comfortable with looping through data and pulling out the specifics and evaluating a user's input. These tactics, and more, will be needed for your next project. I want to tell you now that it's going to require more writing than your first two projects.
