## Project 2
### Pagination and Content Filter

In this second project, I will be creating a program that accepts a list of students, divides that list into pages of 10 students each, creates links to other pages, and updates the HTML dynamically as the user navigates through said pages. Additionally, as I aim to meet the criteria for "Exceeds Expectations", I will be adding in a feature that will allow a user to search students by name or, if no matches are found, will create a message in the HTML to notify him or her.

*__Skills:__ jQuery, DOM traversal & manipulation, unobtrusive JavaScript*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "You did it! Everything is working as you would expect it to. Your code is so short that I'm truly impressed. I like that you make all functions ready to to be executed once the window is up, hence your window.ready() on the first line. It seems you are comfortable with looping through data and pulling out the specifics and evaluating a user's input. These tactics, and more, will be needed for your next project. I want to tell you now that it's going to require more writing than your first two projects.

"Ask away when needed!!"
